# Pokedex Dashboard

The goal of this web application is to provide Pokémon core game players some insights about the Pokémons that would fit specific roles in their team.

The data set used has been posted on Kaggle by [Alberto Barradas](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon). Using R, I added to that data set some information for the sake of representability and ease of filtering.

This application takes the form of a dashboard fully built in R, using the package "shiny". The application is currently deployed on a shinyapps.io server, available [here.](https://l2cgauthier.shinyapps.io/PokedexAnalysis/)
